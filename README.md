# Directed-Graph-Adjacency-List

C# program from 2015. 

Uses an adjacency list over an adjacency matrix for simplicity. Creates a subway system, where, in graph theoretic terms, each vertex is a station and each edge represents a link between two adjacent stations. Parallel lines can connect two adjacent stations.

Can generate fastest route, find critical stations, and recalculates if user deletes a link.
